===============

Here is the server i forked from OtLand and tried to implement the tasks for the Software Delevoper Job application

To make it run properly, i followed the tutorial: https://otland.net/threads/from-windows-10-to-ots-development-machine-for-dummies.268631/

I also created a fork of Meha's OtClient(https://github.com/metaldogs/otclient) to be easist to match with protocol, map, datapack and assets.

Map and Datapack: https://github.com/EPuncker/orts2

To to able to compile, i created a vcpgk manifest so Visual Studio can find all the libraries, i think my PC doesn't like enviroment variables and can't find the libraries in vcpkg folder.
